Dennis worked on the music and key press interactivity of the game play. Using Minimâ€™s BeatDetection and BeatListener, Dennis has randomly chosen letters drop on the beat of the song that is playing. If the letter/s reaches the circle and the user presses the correct key, the circle will flash green, the letter will disappear, and points are added to the score. If the incorrect key is pressed or the letter has not reached the circle, a red circle will flash in the location of the key the user incorrectly pressed. Dennis built this by using a letter class. Each time that the BeatDetector found a beat, a letter object would be created with a random letter value and added to an ArrayList of Letters that begin to drop down the screen toward the circles. Once the object reaches the circle and is correctly key pressed, the object is removed from the ArrayList. If the letter object is not key pressed and goes past the circle it will also be removed. By using Minim and AudioPlayer, the program is able to pause the song and playback at the same spot.
